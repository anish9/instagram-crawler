She wanted new photos, new content, new outfits! Well, those are all things I want too! I like to plan my content a week in advance, curating a somewhat cohesive feed. Sometimes this includes resposting some of my favorites posts, like this one from last year. I wrote a blog post about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy to correlate back to this outfit and photo. It was all about dressing like the blonde beauty and embracing her natural beautiful aesthetic. Plus to some new readers, this re-purposed content isn't re-purposed at all. It's new to those new eyes and new supporters on my feed. So, if you ever ask yourself why something looks familiar or you think you've seen it before, it's because I really love it and would like to post it again. It's as simple as that. Plus, this weather is not dress weather. It's a cozy coat, boot kind of day - which is exactly why this photo is perfect for this dreary New York Monday."}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B5iZqlAjbTx/", "datetime": "2019-12-01T17:04:09.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/74403159_1312680725603328_5420952212616473191_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=9prtGmrggPsAX-T1iH-&oh=12a4c88efd7b9ee9225159df3ee7b2d4&oe=5F01D6F8"], "likes": 1264, "caption": "HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT MY NEW BLOG POST?Tis the season for holiday sales!

Years ago, I learned the hard way that first impressions are the only impressions that matter. I was a Junior in college at The University of Maryland interviewing for two dream fashion internships.

Long story short I was only offered one of the two internships and I‚Äôm almost 100% sure it all came down to my outfit. You may be saying to yourself, maybe I wasn‚Äôt qualified for the other internship. Well folks, the next year I interviewed again for the same company and was immediately hired the next day- so no, it wasn‚Äôt my lack of qualifications.

I‚Äôve been an unlimited RTR member for years and love using it, especially for travel like when I went to Miami. I‚Äôve never worked with the company on a campaign, but hey @renttherunway, maybe I should! Anyways, I discovered these tips a while back and always kept them to myself. My friends are always complaining about the lack of new trends or poor size selection in popular styles. These are problems I no longer have because I figured out the right way to search for newness and your size without the frustrations:\n\n1. New Arrivals occur multiple times a week. Call me crazy, but waiting for Saturday or a ‚ÄúNew Arrivals‚Äù email won‚Äôt does no good. I find Thursday mornings is the best time to discover newness on the site.\n2. Discover new items in your ‚Äúquick search‚Äù section. It‚Äôs impossible to stay abreast of all the new items on the site. Check your ‚ÄúQuick Search‚Äù feed and search by ‚Äúnewest‚Äù to find items you may have missed in the days prior when searching for something new.\n3. Rent items from unknown designers. I always knew about the brand @ladoublej, but didn‚Äôt become a buyer of the brand until renting a piece offered on the RTR site. It‚Äôs a great tool to find emerging brands.\n4. Rent the Runway isn‚Äôt just for dresses. I love renting coats and jackets from the site during the winter. I already own too many coats, but love finding new ones to add to my reptoire. RTR has an amazing selection that should not go unnoticed.\n5. Early mornings are the best time to discover returns. I like to check for returns when I wake in the morning for a fresh selection of items."}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4P5A7blojR/", "datetime": "2019-10-30T16:04:26.000Z", "img_urls": [], "views": 3184, "likes": 665, "caption": "WHATS IN MY BAG?\n\nWHATS IN MY BAG?

Beyond the fantastic Italian food, the service is superb, the location is ideal for downtown folk and it never disappoints. The competition to score a reservation on any given evening or even a spot at the bar is a testament to the excellence of this ten plus year old Italian spot. *What to Wear: Since we were dining on a Sunday evening, I chose to wear a breezy cotton dress with lace-up espadrilles. This look is a tad more casual than I would normally don while dining at @lartusi. I would recommend finding an elevated casual outfit. Denim is fully welcomed, but find a statement top paired with fun footwear or a sleek heel. *What to Order: Begin your journey with their roasted mushroom appetizer. The delectable mix of ricotta salata, fried egg, chilies and mushrooms is heavenly. I prefer not to go overboard with apps, as I like to leave room for my favorite spaghetti dish. Their spaghetti is simply described on the menu with chilies, garlic and parmesan, but the complex flavors are anything but. It remains my go-to meal on their menu. Desert is non optional, as their chocolate budino is a delightful treasure of bittersweet chocolate, whipped cream and chocolate brittle. Feel free to order a glass of wine from their curated wine list. Nothing will disappoint and everything will be wonderful.\nhttp://liketk.it/2EYCc #liketkit @liketoknow.it"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ZYCp4jP41/", "datetime": "2019-09-14T15:22:37.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/70409901_2352956698073370_991975666954636375_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=htLvABeT3LoAX-_C1Gt&oh=28ecb1fe4cf76992a2018fa4b8f494bf&oe=5EFC779B"], "likes": 1683, "caption": "Hi!

Before IG I probably bought a dress/top/pants/etc and only wore it a few times. I just didn't realize how wasteful I was being! It's impractical to buy something and only wear it once. Not only is it financially irresponsible, but also unsustainable for the environment. I purchased this @reformation dress in the middle of June and have already worn it in three different countries (England, Spain, U.S), for various occasions (bachelorette party, dinner with Todd, drinks with friends) and it's only July! Every time I decide to buy something I now second guess myself before swiping the credit card. Cost per wear for this $248 dress? I'm currently at $49, which is pretty good considering it's only been a month since buying it. I encourgage everyone to do the same. Skip those super trendy items for something you LOVE and will wear multiple times.
